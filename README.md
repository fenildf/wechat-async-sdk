# wechat-sdk-solo
   Based on the wechat-sdk,but part of the requests divide from the sdk, so tornado or other web frame work can make it async.
   Already got permissions from the Ace Kwok(doraemonext@gmail.com),my email is damonhowe2010@gmail.com
#why this?
   I got used to the style of the old one,cause Ace have no time to maintein it,I'd rather to do it
